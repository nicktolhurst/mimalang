# MimaLang

MimaLang is a homoiconic multi-paradigm programming language. Inspiration has come from various languages, such as Golang, Clojure, Lisp, C#, F#, and PowerShell. It has no real purpose, other than my own satisfaction with writing a hello-world program in my own language.

The language is bootstrapped in C#, but I am really interested in how it may become a self-hosted compiler - one that will compile itself.
